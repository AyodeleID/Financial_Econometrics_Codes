# Financial Econometrics: Models and Tutorials

## Overview
This repository is a collection of Python and R scripts illustrating major financial econometric models, including random walk, ARMA/ARIMA, ARCH/GARCH, vector autoregression, cointegration and correlation models. Each script demonstrates model implementation with synthetic and real data.

## Contents
- `random_walk/` – Simulating and visualising random walk models.
- `arma_arima/` – Time-series models including ARMA and ARIMA.
- `arch_garch/` – Volatility models such as ARCH, GARCH and IGARCH.
- `var_vecm/` – Vector autoregression and vector error correction models.
- `cointegration/` – Cointegration tests and VECM estimation.
- `correlation_models/` – Constant and dynamic conditional correlation models, copula-GARCH.

## Getting Started
1. Install the required Python and R packages listed in `requirements.txt` and `DESCRIPTION`.
2. Navigate to a subdirectory and run the appropriate script or notebook.
3. Refer to the inline comments and explanations for guidance.

## Visualisations
Each module generates plots to illustrate model behaviour. Examples include simulated price paths, forecast charts, volatility estimates and correlation dynamics.

## Contribution
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to add new models or improve existing scripts. Please open an issue to discuss ideas.
